                    It is synonymous with Rap, medium tempos, drums and claps, rhymes that
                    speak of competition, youth lives, nights, friends, best friends, shared
                    lives, music, life in music.

                    Dostrescinco is a band that has become strong in the underground and a
                    little more. Their concerts are true parties, without exception, they have
                    known how to fill spaces such as La Trastienda, Sala Zitarrosa, Montevideo
                    Music Box and the Teatro Solís.

                    Its members are five, five rappers, of which one is also a DJ and
                    another beatmaker. His flow has a mathematical cadence, the end of rhymes
                    always seems to fall in the perfect place, one can wait for the auction of the
                    phrases, the backlash of words, but these are always different, these
                    they always surprise without ever forcing the tempo.

                    Each member of the band stamps in their lyrics a transit of sensations;
                    the years pass and they do not come alone, each of the emcees is nourished by experiences and
                    they turn to music. “Recordis” comes from the Latin “re-cordis”,
                    which means to go through the heart again, to get away from immediacy to
                    bring to the surface those memories that nourish the creative process. twothreefive
                    adopts this name for his record work for
                    several reasons, the strongest undoubtedly has to do with showing something else,
                    leave your heart and soul in each letter, in each note; reveal feelings and
                    be open to anyone who wants to discover their music. Quality rap.
